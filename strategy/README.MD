# Strategy pattern

In computer programming, the strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) is a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime.

Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

In OOP it is achieved through abstracting concrete strategies by inheriting from an abstract class or implementing interface.
